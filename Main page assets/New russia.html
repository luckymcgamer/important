			A bit of history<br>
			New Russia was created as a small, fun server. The more members it got, the more fun it became, at one point it turned
			into a discord nation. Russia nowadays but communist. There was a lot of hate towards weebs, which caused some problems 
			with other servers sometimes. At one point there was made a huge mistake, causing the end of the 100+ member server.
			Quickly after that they staff recreated it, and added better security measures. So far we have been attacked once, but it didn’t
			last longer than 2 minutes due to or security system. We’re searching for more members so our nation can grow as big as it
			was before and will be able to defend the bigger threats even better!
